Hey Alex, Rene here, listen when your marking this please don't deduct marks from the other group members
for this hand-in, gathering the files was my responsibility and some stuff like 
Daltons arrows might have been overwritten,
I made a lot of mistakes and honestly I should have taken this responsibilty more seriously. 
The other group members did wonderful work and I solely messed up, so please take this into consideration.
I don't want their marks to suffer for my mistakes.
